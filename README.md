## 💬 Sample Interaction

> **AELI:** Good morning, miss. You've got low spoons today, but the bagel was an excellent choice. Shall I suggest a low-effort goal?

> **User:** yeah. something light.

> **AELI:** How about tidying just your desk? One zone, five minutes, and I'll queue up some lo-fi for it.
